Immediate:
+ let the user add new planes
- deal with missing plane 404 on /planes/not-existing
- error management on the server and on the client
- validation on server write and on client form
- angular $http: add catch() in service to throw custom exception
-- e.g. 404 on plane load
--- do not show the grid
-- e.g. 400 on plane creation
--- show validation errors to the user
- one aggregation framework operation

Future:
- how to do CPU intensive tasks?
- cache generations
- move the window over the plane, zoom in and out
- random generation on client side
- evaluate https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router
-- permalink someway in the URL?
